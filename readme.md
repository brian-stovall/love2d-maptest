This is a quick test checking out love2d.
I hope to animate from spritesheets and have some interaction with a background map -
including boundaries that stop the character and hopefully some way to have
scripts fire at certain map co-ordinates!
Deprecated - ended up a state-ridden nightmare... will try again 
programming functionally someday soon.
